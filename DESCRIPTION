Description: The package is developed to automate the simulation-based power analysis for planned missing designs in the context of longitudinal studies. More specifically, this package is featured with a direct application to the scenarios where an unexpected funding cut occurs during the course of a longitudinal study. Users can use this package to search for PM designs that yield sufficient power for testing focal parameters.
