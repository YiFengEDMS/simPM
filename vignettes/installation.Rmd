## Install _simPM_

Currently `simPM` is hosted on GitHub. The latest development version of `simPM` can be installed using the code provided below. 

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
intall_github("YiFengEDMS/simPM")
``` 

Alternatively, the users can also try using the following code to install `simPM`.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YiFengEDMS/simPM")
```

It is possible that errors would occur if your R version is older than v3.5.2. If the installation fails, we recommend you to check your R version and to update R and RStudio to the latest version available.
